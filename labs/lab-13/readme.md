Given arrays of size 4, left, right, result, defined in main(), which represent 2x2 matrices, write code to make result = left times right.

```
int main()
{
  double left[] = {1,2,3,4};
  double right[] = {3,2,-1,0};
  double result[4];
  // code to make result = left * right as matrices
  // print result
}

```

Place code in matrix.cpp.
