The student was tasked with creating a flowchart for a program that prompts the user for their birth year and the current year, and then performs calculations based on that information. This assignment is part of the CS 101 curriculum. To demonstrate the practical application of this task, I converted the flowchart into executable code, providing the student with concrete examples of how to transition from planning to implementation. I showcased this process through two distinct examples: one written in C++ and the other in Python.
