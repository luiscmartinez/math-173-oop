# General Notes:
This example uses six if statements to compare two numbers input by the user. If the condition in any of these if statements is satisfied, the output statement associated with that if statement is executed.

Notice that each if statement has a single statement in its body!
Todo: link an example that specifies if statements with multiple-statement bodies aka compound statement or block

## Equality operators:
* `==`
* `!=`

equality operator `==` is testing for equality .. while `!=` is testing for inequality

the assignment operator `=` associates from right to left so an expression such as x = y = 0 is evaluated as if it had been written x = (y = 0).

## Relational operators
* `>`
* `<`
* `<=`
* `>=`
