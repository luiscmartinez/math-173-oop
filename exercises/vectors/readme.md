// declarations means => invoking it
// definitions -> mean is defining it

//  header file extensions: .h or .hpp
//  header file: sum.h
//  # program once


// #include "sum.h" -> isn't c++ code it literally just inserts the code from that file.
// so then in main.cpp we should include that sum.h file so that we can keep the declarations and definitions separate
