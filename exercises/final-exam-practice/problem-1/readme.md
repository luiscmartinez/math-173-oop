A Pythagorean triple is a list of three positive integers a, b, c such that
`a2 + b2 = c2.`

(Examples: 3, 4, 5 or 5, 12, 13.)
Define a C++ function is_triple which takes three ints as input and returns true if they form a Pythagorean triple, or false otherwise. (Assume the third argument is the largestâ€”do not check all permutations of the integers.)
